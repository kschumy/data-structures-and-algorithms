## About

All of these auxiliary data structures are from LeetCode, which periodically
includes one or more of these data structures in the input statement and 
requires their use in solutions to many questions. 

No modifications have been made to them, even when obvious changes could be made
(inheritance, etc.). The intent is to use them across all questions that require 
them, and any modifications could have unintended impacts.
